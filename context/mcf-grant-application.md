MCF's Community Building grant

**Application Questions:**

**One Sentence Proposal Description (Limit: 25 words)**

Describe your proposed project or activity by completing the following sentence in 25 words or less: We request

support...  
Note: This sentence may be used in our donor portal and should be written for those unfamiliar with the project and your organization. Clearly and briefly describe the project. For example, “to engage high school students in home weatherization projects for local low-income families” or “to partner with the town to add benches to the community park and offer tai chi classes to all ages.” If awarded a grant, we may also use this description in our communications (for example, website, brochures, press releases). It works best when it is short and simple. Avoid using acronyms and jargon.

We request support to launch a collaboration of  local organizations to provide digital equity programming in workforce pathways and telehealth for Stonington-area’s burgeoning Connectivity Hub. (25 words)  
To launch a collaboration of local organizations to provide workforce pathways, education, telehealth and digital equity programming for a new, regional connectivity hub in Stonington.

**2\. Describe the people this project will serve. (Limit: 250 words)**  
   
We are looking for demographic information (such as age range, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rural/urban, etc.) about the people who will directly benefit or be served by this project. It can also be helpful to know if they are underserved or have less access to resources. If the audience is the general public, then provide demographic information based on the community that will be targeted for attendance or participation.

The people who will directly benefit from the Connectivity Hub are fishing families from the greater Stonington/Blue Hill region, and individuals from the “covered populations” that are most impacted by the digital divide in the Deer Isle-Stonington region.   
These populations are identified in Congress’s bipartisan Digital Equity Act as the following: low-income households, older adults, incarcerated/formerly incarcerated individuals, those with a language barrier (including English language learners or those with low literacy levels), individuals with disabilities, members of racial/ethnic group minorities, veterans, and those living in rural areas.   
According to social vulnerability data from the Maine Connectivity Authority, Stonington and surrounding communities have particularly high unemployment rates and tend to have fewer educational credentials and lower incomes than the state average. The Deer Isle-Stonington region has one of the state’s highest rates of population over 60, and mean travel time to the nearest healthcare facility is over 60 minutes. Collaborating partners on this project include organizations focused on the well-being of older adults, alongside those working primarily with high school students and young adults on career aspirations.   
The target population encompasses this multi-generational community that has built their culture and livelihoods on the water. As climate change and new regulations pose a threat to those livelihoods, the target population of this project includes the entire community that will feel the ripple effects of economic changes.  According to DMR data, this region has some of the state’s highest density of lobster fishing license holders. There are 378 license holders in Deer Isle and Stonington, and an additional 215 in the 7 neighboring communities including Isle au Haut.

Connectivity Hub programming will directly benefit fishing families from the greater Stonington/Blue Hill region, and individuals from the “covered populations” that are most impacted by the digital divide in the Deer Isle-Stonington region. 

As identified in Congress’s bipartisan Digital Equity Act, these include: low-income households, older adults, incarcerated/formerly incarcerated individuals, those with a language barrier (including ELL or those with low literacy levels), individuals with disabilities, members of racial/ethnic group minorities, veterans, and those living in rural areas.

**Approximately how many people will be directly served? (Enter a number)**  
   
When estimating the number of people directly served, focus on those who will most directly benefit. For example, if you are providing a program for children, the children attending the program will be the ones to directly benefit. However, you can explain when describing the people being served that there will be others who will indirectly benefit such as parents and families.

**500**

*NOTES: Targeting any of the 2000 adults in the region (name surrounding communities) can access the Connectivity Hub, link to lobster tag data \- ex. there are X fishermen that access Stonington*

*More realistically 100? (7 primary programming providers will be Haystack, PL, 2 libraries, adult ed, community center, health center) \- if they each bring in an average of 15 people, that’s 105*  
   
**3\. WHAT is the GOAL of the project and WHAT are the SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES you propose to do? (Limit: 250 words)**

It’s fine to have one big goal or there may be 2-3 smaller, more short-term goals. The review committee is interested in WHAT you are trying to do and HOW you will do it. The committee will consider if these seem reasonable and achievable in the context of all the information provided.

The goal of this project is to develop a collaborative community effort for programming of a new regional Connectivity Hub based in Stonington. The Hub is a response to  threats including the impact of climate change on the lobster industry and opportunities like regional high speed internet and funding programs.  
Strategies:

1. Establish an organizational structure for a new collaborative of community organizations that will provide workforce pathways, education, telehealth and digital equity programming including Haystack’s Fab Lab, Project Launch, Stonington and Deer isle libraries, Adult Education, and Island Community Center, Island Medical Center. Organizational structures to explore include a distributed agency model with a representative board making group decisions or a lead agency model where one of the collaborators with capacity assumes leadership and coordinates with all other partnering organizations.   
2. Collaborators develop and implement pilot programs that build on existing approaches and offerings. Programming ideas include:   
- a staffing schedule for a new Community Navigator position, calendar and hours that complement those of the participating organizations.  
- community open houses to raise awareness and collect feedback on the Connectivity Hub concept and programming.   
- Pilot workshops and short courses staffed by one or more of the collaborators.   
3.   Establish  the historic former school building in Stonington as the pilot hub while pursuing additional funding to renovate it into a formal Connectivity Hub.  
4. Island Institute will provide facilitation and technical assistance as the collaborators meet frequently to develop organizational structure and pilot programs.

**4\.  Which of the following will be increased for the people served in this proposed project:**  
 	***Select all that apply \- All*** 

**Skills/abilities**

**Knowledge**

**Well-being**

 

**HOW will your project increase the items selected above? (Limit: 250 words)**

   
Be specific about what skills, type of abilities, kind of knowledge, or if well-being will be increased or improved. The review committee is trying to understand how people will benefit from your proposed activities.

Skills: Many in the fishing community will soon change their workforce pathway, by adding skills for additional employment while continuing in the lobster industry, or pursuing new career paths full time. Many will require support using the internet and accessing digital platforms and tools. Basic digital literacy skills are needed as well as instruction on devices. Because many have limited experience in other sectors, they will need assistance with creating resumes, applying for jobs and education or training programs online. Our local **libraries** already provide some of this support and the Connectivity Hub will support adults in the community through programming based on **Project Launch**’s model of supporting young adults to build skills to successfully transition to careers and/or college

Knowledge: We will provide community learning and enrichment opportunities through individual and group classes, online and in person. **Adult Education** helps community members complete high school or other credentials and **Haystack** offers a wide range of technology-based arts and applied course work.

Well-being: Medical services in the region are limited and often involve traveling, creating a particular hardship for older adults. **The Health Center** will assist with access to devices for tele-health and there will be a private meeting space for tele-health appointments. Social gatherings, exercise classes and other events will improve community well-being, particularly for older adults.

**5\. We will involve the people we serve in the proposed project’s:**  
	***Select all that apply***

**Design \- yes**  
**Delivery**  
**Evaluation \- yes**

**HOW does your proposed project involve the people served in the items selected above? (Limit: 250 words)**

The collaboration will be informed by the program development practices of each individual organization, many of which do involve the people they serve in their program design, delivery and evaluation, so to some extent, this best practice in program development will be part of how we work from the outset.  As the Connectivity Hub programming develops, we will seek both broad community input and specific feedback and insight from individual community members, including those from the fishing community, those with limited digital literacy, those with low-incomes and older adults.  

(89 words)

   
We believe programs that incorporate feedback, input, and insight from those closest to the issue will be the most effective. This grant program requires that there is involvement with those that the project is seeking to serve or benefit at the design stage, during delivery or implementation, or in the evaluation. The review committee will be evaluating the breadth and depth of engagement.  
   
   
   
**6\. Select one community resource your project strengthens.**

**Organization**  
**Partnerships \-** focus on the collaboration  
**Buildings**  
**Natural Environment**

**HOW does your project strengthen the community resource selected above? (Limit: 250 words)**

The saying ‘the smartest person in the room is the room’ was definitely at play when the identified community partner organizations came together for the first time late last year to learn about the Town of Stonington’s plans for a Connectivity Hub to support the local fishing community and broader region. These partners each have a unique approach towards serving our community and they also have much in common. The mutual respect and support for each other is strong and provides a great foundation upon which to build the Connectivity Hub’s programming.  There is a palpable desire to work together to increase each organization’s individual impact by joining forces to maximize the benefit to our community and to serve as a model for other communities along the coast of Maine.

This project brings together a unique, first time collaboration between the partnering organizations. The saying ‘the smartest person in the room is the room’ was definitely at play when the identified community partner organizations came together for the first time last year to learn about the Town of Stonington’s plans for a Connectivity Hub to support the its local and regional fishing communities. Deer Isle-Stonington is blessed with a rich array of community programming assets. The partners serve different socio-cultural sectors and community needs while also having much in common. Mutual respect and support for each other is strong and based on long histories of collaboration and support, which provide a great foundation upon which to build the Connectivity Hub’s programming.  There is a palpable desire to work together to increase each organization’s individual impact by joining forces to maximize the benefit to our community and to serve as a model for other communities along the coast of Maine. 

 

While people are a community resource, here you want to identify a different community resource that the project will strengthen. This could be a resource that everyone in the community would have access to such as a community park or it could be a unique program that your organization provides or a partnership between the municipality and a local organization that offers a critical service to certain members of the community. The review committee is looking to see how a community resource might be improved, used more, or made more accessible.
