**Project Overview** 

**Completed** \- Apr 12 2024 

**Project Overview** 

**Project Summary** 

Please provide a high-level description of your proposed Connectivity Hub project in 3-5 sentences. This will be used as a general descriptor in grant lists or on our website. 

*For example, "The proposed Madison Connectivity Hub will expand the existing vet center to create a world class facility providing workforce, education, telehealth programs to veterans in our rural community. The facility will also provide access to high speed fiber internet, devices on site and to loan, digital skills classes, and internet safety education and serve as a critical anchor institution on Main Street."* 

The Stonington Connectivity Hub transforms a beloved, historic 1905 school building into a world-class facility on the State’s most productive working waterfront: a fully-accessible central gathering place for the region’s marine based community-in-transition, connecting a diverse group of disadvantaged audiences to programs and services in three critical areas: community education, workforce pathways, and digital equity focused on health monitoring and senior programs. This supported walk-in location will also provide equitable digital access to connectivity, devices to loan, skills support, and internet safety education, serving as a critical anchor institution for our island's Main Street "Upper Village" development area.

**Fees/Costs** 

Are there existing or planned fees for accessing the organization facilities or services (such as membership fees, class fees, etc.)? 

No

16 / 56   
**Community Anchor Institution** 

Please describe how the existing or proposed facility will serve as a community gathering place and resource. Be sure to include a description of the services the public (or target audience) will have access to. 

The new Stonington Connectivity Hub (C-HUB) – a fully-accessible, friendly, staffed, walk-in location – will be a world-class facility on the State’s most productive working waterfront: a central gathering place for the region’s marine-based community-in-transition, connecting a diverse group of disadvantaged target audiences to access to programs and services in three critical areas: community education, workforce pathways, and digital literacy and access with a focus on health monitoring each of which, separately and together, will address the many existing barriers to available and affordable high speed internet services and devices. 

The facility, co-located with an existing Small Business Center in a beloved, historic, 1905 building in downtown Stonington on the State’s most productive working waterfront, will provide well-equipped classroom, office, and maker space for project partners Deer Isle Adult and Community Education, Project Launch, Haystack Mountain School of Crafts’ Fabrication Lab public programs, and the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety. In addition to these resident partners, the building and its programs are designed to serve as the hub in a hub-and spoke model of resource and service provision for access to our region’s many existing programs at our two local libraries and Island Community Center, and as provided by the area’s Community Action Program, Downeast Community Partners. 

The proposed C-HUB facility is in the heart of the island’s main business district and the anchor for the development district known as the "Upper Village:" a short walk from the Town’s commercial fishing pier and working waterfront, as well as its public library and the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries; and on the same property as the Island Community Center. The building itself already houses 18 other locally-owned, individually operated businesses and organizations. 

The programs of Deer Isle Adult and Community Education, Project Launch, Haystack Mountain's School of Craft's Fabrication Lab, and the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety will be at the heart of the Connectivity Hub, welcoming walk-in or pre-scheduled visits and inviting residents who have not previously had access to digital technology and support. 

Deer Isle Adult and Community Education has historically been shuffled between Deer Isle-Stonington’s elementary school and high school facilities, with frequent relocation driven by K-12 programming needs. The schools are located out of town and require vehicle transportation for access. As it is currently situated in the Elementary School, Adult Ed students must be buzzed into the locked school, sign in at the main office, and navigate through student traffic to arrive at the Adult Ed Classroom, which is equipped with a failing Epson projector and a

17 / 56   
whiteboard. During the day, classes and HiSET exams are often disrupted by announcements over the school’s intercom and students lining up for lunch in the hallway. Due to its continually transitory location, the program is in competition with school day and after school programming for use of shared spaces like the library, and shared devices such as the school’s interactive Promethean board. This location has proven to be too much of a barrier for multiple students who have anxiety disorders, and the director has had to borrow classroom space off campus to meet their learning needs. As friendly and welcoming as we strive to make our K-12 schools, their environments are not particularly conducive to adult comfort or learning. 

In the proposed C-HUB facility, Deer Isle Adult and Community Education will practice a true open-door policy that centers adult learning and concerns, with spaces, furniture, and equipment appropriate for the pillars of adult education programming: digital literacy, high school completion prep/testing, diploma program classes, college and career access support, as well as workforce training. The island has a long tradition of oral culture practices, where a lot of work is done and connections are made through dropping in for informal conversations, and running into or meeting people in “third” spaces. The program is excited at the prospect of access to an appropriate space for formal learning practices, which is to include a new collaborative third space environment for islanders to connect in, less formally. There is much room and need to grow this program once appropriately located. 

Creating a shared space for programming, meetings, and drop-in hours with Deer Isle Adult & Community Education, Project Launch, and Haystack will foster more collaborative programming between those entities as they see where their missions connect and overlap, while sharing a building and/or neighborhood with organizations including the Healthy Island Project, the Island Food Pantry, Opiate Free Island Partnership, and the Maine Center for Coastal Fisheries will help cultivate inter-organizational relationships likely to lead to “warm hand off” referrals and future collaborative programming. 

Project Launch, a community non-profit organization established in 2012, offers college & career readiness and transition resources to students aged 15-25 years. Project Launch works in partnership with the local school system and to date, over 185 students have voluntarily enrolled in our program. Students and families engage with a multitude of supports, including college mentors, academic and financial aid counseling, apprenticeship opportunities and college & career readiness skill-building workshops. Project Launch is currently exploring an expansion of our programming that would focus more formally on adult workforce pathways and career transitions. The proposed C-HUB will be an integral part of those efforts and would allow participants use of state-of-the-art digital learning resources and would bring Project Launch into close programmatic and location proximity to other community organizations with a similar focus, including Adult Education and Haystack. 

Since its establishment in 1950 off the coast of Maine, Haystack Mountain School of Craft has been at the forefront of connecting individuals through the power of craft and design. Set against the backdrop of Maine's

18 / 56   
serene landscape, Haystack fosters a unique environment where the freedom to engage with materials and develop new ideas flourishes within a supportive and inclusive community setting. At its core, Haystack is committed to facilitating multidisciplinary programs where artists, learners, and technologists coalesce, exploring the vast intersections of craft, art, and design. 

Renowned for its robust network of STEM professionals and a groundbreaking partnership with MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms and the Fab Foundation, Haystack has been a pioneer in integrating technology with traditional craftsmanship. The establishment of the Fab Lab in 2011, in collaboration with MIT, marked a significant milestone for Haystack, embedding advanced digital fabrication and technology into the school's curriculum. This integration has not only advanced the field of craft but also pioneered innovative community programs, positioning the Fab Lab as a cornerstone of Haystack's mission. 

As a member of the expansive international network of over 2,000 small-scale fabrication centers that span across 100 countries, Haystack's Fab Lab connects a global community of learners, educators, technologists, and innovators. This extensive network has enabled collaboration with over 100 experts across diverse fields such as engineering, design, software development, and material science, fostering innovative solutions to community centric challenges. Through projects that encompass artificial intelligence, digital fabrication, and augmented reality, Haystack explores the confluence of art and technology, driving forward both fields in unique and impactful ways. 

The initiative to establish a Connectivity Hub in Hancock County, a region recognized for its rural charm and economic challenges, aligns with Haystack's long-standing mission to democratize access to STEM education and cutting-edge technologies. This proposal aims to bridge the digital divide in this low-income area of coastal Maine, leveraging the rich experience and resources of Haystack and its partners. Under the leadership of Dr. Rutter, who has directed the Fab Lab program for the past four years, Haystack has been instrumental in weaving community based education and research programs into the fabric of the region. This proposal is not just a continuation of Haystack's visionary work; it's an evolution, promising to expand the horizons of our community's youth and pave the way for a future where innovation and craftsmanship converge, creating endless possibilities for growth and development. 

Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety fishermen’s health navigator program likewise promises to be groundbreaking for our coastal communities. Their three year grant to provide a community health monitoring system for fishing communities will bring unique services to the Stonington region unlike any the fishing community has experienced before. Already, in trial programming, they have been able to attract more fishermen and diggers for health screenings than any previous program. Their co-location in the hub is an exciting and unprecedented opportunity for all residents in our coast region to improve their health outcomes in a space that is welcoming and

19 / 56   
without the corporate and other intimidations of the larger health care system around us. 

Importantly, Haystack and Deer Isle Adult and Community Education will be providing digital literacy and access through the hub to which the community has not otherwise had access; and together Haystack, DIACE, and Project Launch will be able to initiate workforce pathways and education that none of them individually have been able to leverage successfully on a wide enough scale. The C-HUB gives us all the opportunity to collaborate, cooperate, and draw people together to a central, well-equipped location to move forward together. 

**Other Community Anchor Institutions in the Area** 

Are there other existing community anchor institutions within 10 miles of the proposed project location? These include libraries, community centers, other non-profits or spaces that provide internet and/or access to computers and other devices. Traditional schools and hospitals do not need to be included unless they provide additional community services. 

Yes 

**More Details on Existing Community Anchor Institutions** 

Please provide a bulleted list of the nearby existing community anchor institutions and the services they provide. 

These existing community anchor institutions are collaborating partners on this project, integrating schedules and services with the C-HUB in a hub-and-spoke model to provide more comprehensive services than any one of them is currently capable on its own: 

\* Chase Emerson Memorial Library (Deer Isle): digital access and literacy 

\* Stonington Public Library: digital access and literacy

20 / 56   
**Unique Resources & Demand** 

Please describe how this project provides a new or different resource to the community, such as different types of amenities or a unique space for a specific population. If you have information about demand for the proposed facility, such as survey responses or the number of impacted people your organization is already serving that might use the facility, please describe this. 

The proposed C-Hub will provide a first-ever, fully-accessible opportunity for residents to engage simultaneously with a group of partnered community organizations working together to address a variety of critical needs, including telehealth and health monitoring, adult workforce pathways and social-emotional supports for all ages and especially for the region’s large demographic of seniors. The C-Hub will also, as needed, provide a neutral, welcoming, fully digital space for community meetings, workshops and classes. 

Traditionally, many local organizations engaged with education have partnered with the K-12 system because there’s a captive audience of learners, dedicated/centralized facilities, and a large number of staff members to collaborate with. It is substantially more difficult for these organizations to provide resources and learning opportunities to the adult population- because there’s been no core space or organizing entity dedicated to hosting and coordinating efforts for the sort of one-stop educational/wellness delivery that occurs in the K-12 system. Organizations have often been siloed in their efforts on behalf of the adult population, creating their own programming and events, using their own spaces, and their own marketing to provide services to adults. 

The opportunity of applying for funds to create a C-Hub has coincided with the rebuilding and re-visioning of Deer Isle Adult and Community Education, and an increase in municipal demands for adult education services, based on very recent assessment and planning efforts. In 2023, Stonington developed an economic resiliency plan which included “Retain, attract, and educate a year-round population and workforce” as a core strategy. Deer Isle’s comprehensive plan, approved in March of 2024, identified that the town needs to “Improve work readiness of students and retraining opportunities for older workers” and the strategies included “Provide funding for offering shop classes and other training locally” and “Seek increased funding for Project Launch.” 

To those ends, Deer Isle Adult and Community Education is expanding its staff in FY 25 from only having a full time Director/Teacher, to adding a full time trades instructor (shifting from the High School budget so as to keep Industrial Arts learning opportunities local, and expand access to the adult community), and hosting an Island Institute Fellow to help develop marketing and outreach systems, and increase the capacity to facilitate digital literacy classes and collaborative enrichment programming that takes a holistic approach to healthy aging on in our region.

21 / 56   
DIACE is also building the lease of a classroom/multi-office space in the proposed site of the C-Hub into their budget and will move the bulk of their programming to that space in July of 2024, and plans to provide shared office space for Project Launch. Thus far in FY 24, with a skeleton staff and limited program visibility, DIACE digital literacy classes hosted in partnership with the National Digital Equity Center have served 29 community members, and enrollments continue to grow. The bulk of the digital literacy students are over the age of 60; 75% of the high school completion students are low-income and receiving public assistance; 50% of the college and career access students are low-income and receiving public assistance. All of this programming would make use of the C-Hub facility and equipment.

**Facility Ownership Information** 

Do you own or lease the facility where the capital improvements will be conducted? 

Own 

**Ownership/Lease Narrative** 

Please provide detailed narrative describing how the organization will retain ownership or lease of the facility for a minimum of five years after the completion of the project. 

The Town of Stonington received ownership of this 1905 school building from the Consolidated School District (CSD) in 2001\. At the time of transfer, the Town conducted a feasibility study for converting the space for senior housing but did not find sufficient demand. Subsequently, the Town successfully converted the more than 10,000 square feet of space into a small business hub hosting 18 small offices, whose rent supports the building’s maintenance. The Town has no plans for releasing ownership of the building. 

**Connectivity Infrastructure** 

Please describe the current connectivity infrastructure at the facility. Does the building have internet access currently? If so, who is the provider? Is there WiFi offered in the building currently? Can people outside the building access the WiFi? 

CCI Fiber Internet (Fidium) – Stonington was a regional leader in bringing fiber to Town buildings and residences. All Town of Stonington buildings are equipped with high speed fiber optical internet and WiFi. This proposal seeks to upgrade the existing WiFi network to strengthen it, make it more resilient, and to segment off the C-HUB from the small business network.

**Project Administration** 

Please describe how your organization will administer the project throughout its lifecycle. This should include a description of how your organization will be sure that the project is meeting its benchmarks and adhering to the U.S. Treasury and MCA's compliance and reporting policies. If your organization may require assistance in these areas, please share how MCA may support. If your organization has managed or executed other similar projects please describe those briefly here. 

The Town of Stonington regularly manages federally-funded grant projects and our municipal team is accustomed to managing federal requirements. The Town is the current recipient of multiple federal earmarks, as well as planning grants through state agencies dealing with climate-change related sea level rise and necessary remediations; and a Northern Borders Regional Commission Catalyst Grant to raise a section of road made vulnerable by climate conditions. 

The Town will both incorporate this funding into its traditional fiscal management, compliance and reporting systems, lead by Finance Director Lucretia Bradshaw; and also expand its project administration into more in person oversight of this important project to Town Manager Kathleen Billings and Economic & Community Development Director Linda Nelson. Billings managed the previous transition of the building from a school to a Small Business Center, and has been actively involved in the transitions and maintenance of other historic Town owned properties including the Island Community Center, the Town Hall, and most recently the Town's purchase of the Odd Fellow's Hall. Nelson was responsible for the ground-up restoration of the Stonington Opera House, the Town's only building on the National Register of Historic Places, which, under her direction, went from abandonment to the thriving cornerstone of the Town's year-round economy. Both are well known to and respected by area contractors. 

As a small Town of only 1000 citizens, Stonington achieves a lot with minimal staffing. We thereby greatly appreciate agencies' support of these projects by staying in good contact, being flexible and understanding of our limitations, and offering guidance and support throughout the project as may be requested.

**People Served** 

|  | Please describe how your project will reach and serve this particular covered population, including an estimate of the number of people anticipated to be reached and/or served. Please enter N/A if this is not a target audience. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Persons who are 60 years of age or older | Digital Literacy classes provided by the National Digital Equity Center through Adult Education in the past year have proved increasingly popular with this audience. Adult Ed intends to develop in-house digital literacy programming to better suit the scheduling needs, and desire for deeper learning voiced by community members who have taken the NDEC classes. We anticipate serving 30-70 community members in this demographic per year with digital literacy support and programming.  Many of the current lobstermen in our community are 60+ years old and it is anticipated that many of those folks will soon be exploring new career paths due to changes in the fishing industry.  Haystack Fab Lab programs will be available to community members of all ages and therefore would cover this population. |

Incarcerated or formerly incarcerated individuals Deer Isle Adult Ed is partnering with RSU 24 Adult Ed to assess current services offered to this population in the 

region, and working with the county correctional facility 

to improve services to the incarcerated or formerly 

incarcerated will be a part of Deer Isle Adult Ed’s 

upcoming strategic planning process. 

Part of the WorkReady program will include discussion 

of and instruction around accounting for a criminal 

record when applying for jobs. This portion of the 

programming will include guest speakers who have 

successfully navigated this challenge themselves. 

We would anticipate providing meaningful services to 

small numbers of this population beginning in years 3-5

32 / 56   
of C-Hub operation. 

| Veterans | A large but as yet unknown % of our regional population are veterans. As part of this project, we seek to create a baseline of specific needs for this population, and to reach and serve them primarily via the community health worker and health assessment and monitoring programs geared toward marine workers. |
| :---- | :---- |
| Persons with disabilities | In FY 24, 55% of the students who enrolled in High School Completion/College Career Access programs through Deer Isle Adult and Community Education identified as disabled. Disabilities included physical, mental health, and learning conditions.  Adaptive technology, ADA accessibility, and access to quiet/private learning spaces have been critical to student retention and success, but Deer Isle Adult and Community Education has frequently had to borrow space and devices to meet these needs. The C-Hub would improve the quality and consistency of services to learners with all varieties of disability.  DIACE has also partnered with an ADHD learning coach (diagnosed later in life with ADHD themselves) to pilot courses on living with ADHD as an adult, and to aid parents supporting children with ADHD.  Our digital literacy classes generally draw aging community members who face declining mobility as well as hearing and vision impairment. Topics for these classes include using digital tools for health monitoring and improvements, as well as medical access.  As we increase collaboration with area healthcare organizations, and increase access to telemedicine, we estimate serving 30-50 people per year in this population, a number we would expect to increase over time. |

Members of a racial or ethnic minority group In FY 24, two of the of the nine students who enrolled in High School Completion/College Career Access 

programs through Deer Isle Adult and Community 

Education were from Native American or partially Native

33 / 56   
American families. 

The DIACE lead teacher for instruction in the home 

building trades is Native American. 

One goal of Deer Isle Adult and Community Education 

is to focus on how we communicate with and support 

learners coming from predominantly oral cultures, and 

create space for all learners to develop cultural 

competency and self-advocacy skills. 

An action that Deer Isle Adult and Community 

Education is taking on that front is to partner with Isle 

Theater Company to develop an English Language Arts 

course that focuses on oral culture and the power of 

storytelling in a variety of contexts, including stand-up 

comedy, substance abuse & trauma recovery, the 

justice system, and advocacy work. While the course will 

be designed to satisfy an ELA core requirement for 

DIACE’s diploma program, it will also be offered as a 

part of enrichment programming. 

| Rural residents | Our sweet spot\! Located as we are on an island in downeast Maine, nearly 100% of the regional population our programs serve are rural residents, though Haystack has a proven ability to draw learners from further afield. |
| :---- | :---- |

Individuals with a language barrier, including those who are English learners or have low literacy levels   
Perhaps the greatest % of population the Stonington C HUB will serve are those with low literacy levels. This continues to be its own epidemic in our region due to our underserved populations and the huge wealth disparity gap between local and seasonal residents. 

As needed, Deer Isle Adult Ed will contract a local certified reading specialist to provide in-person services to low-literacy learners. Having an adult-centered program and space to support their learning will be critical to bringing students into the process, and to build cohorts of learners. A connectivity HUB, and the ability to loan out devices will also better allow us to leverage digital learning with this population. We anticipate that numbers served would grow over time, beginning with 1-3 students in the first year, and increasing to 5-7 a year as the program develops a positive track record and gains visibility.

34 / 56 

Individuals living in households with incomes not exceeding 150 percent of the poverty level   
Also as needed, Deer Isle Adult & Community Education will contract a certified TEFL, who lives locally and works online. Other Adult Ed programs in Hancock County use this teacher. Deer Isle Adult & Community Education staff will work with English learners to support the tech aspects of distance learning. 

The HBI Pre-Apprenticeship Certificate Program offers the curriculum materials in Spanish as well as English. 

Currently our area has a low number of English learners, so anticipated numbers are low, but we intend to prepare the ground for an increase in this population. Working with English learners will be a part of the DIACE professional development plan. 

In the 2020 Census, Deer Isle-Stonington had a poverty rate of 14.2% compared to a state average of 10.8%. In FY 24, 55% of the students who enrolled in High School Completion/College Career Access programs through Deer Isle Adult and Community Education identified as low-income. 

Both the High School Completion and College/Career Access programs offered by Adult Education programs naturally target low income learners, because it is difficult to increase household income without a high school credential, workforce training, or continuing education. Project Launch, and WorkReady programs aim to ensure that participants are able to secure and retain employment that affords a living wage and that suits their interests, aptitudes, and values. 

Financial literacy classes will help learners manage the money they do have, and can identify and navigate financial resources and supports that might be required to help cover living expenses. 

We anticipate reaching 15-30 people in this population with these programs in the early years, and that the numbers will increase as our organizations build capacity, efficiency, and visibility.

35 / 56   
This population also has some overlap with our aging 

population, as some community members are living on 

fixed incomes that do not exceed 150% of the poverty 

level, and no longer have the ability to improve their 

income through participating in the workforce. We will be 

targeting this segment of the low income population 

with health and wellness programming, digital 

literacy/access, and telehealth support. We anticipate 

an additional 15-30 people per year in the early years.

**Workforce Programs** 

What workforce training or workforce programs will be enabled through this project? In addition, please describe how the capital improvements will enable the mission and vision of the project and your organization. For the types of workforce programming that can be supported by this program and examples please refer to the Capital Projects Fund Guidance and Connectivity Hubs Application Guidance. 

*For example, this could include a description of specific workforce trainings to be provided on site, such as electrical or welding programs, or a description of the work placement services that will be provided.* 

This site will enable Deer Isle Adult and Community Education to run the WorkReady credentialing program- a 60 hour course created by the Department of Education to develop the professional skills and habits required to successfully apply for and succeed in a job. This program requires that the site include a computer lab, as skills covered include digital literacy. 

Beginning in the fall of 2024, Deer Isle Adult & Community Education will offer the Home Builders International Pre Apprenticeship Certificate Training (PACT). Approved by the Department of Labor, the PACT curriculum integrates contextual, work-based learning with vocational and academic skills training in the classroom, and learners earn industry-recognized and validated credentials. 75% of the instruction is hands-on and competency based. While the bulk of the programming will be delivered in the Industrial Arts shop at the Deer Isle Stonington High School, the connectivity HUB would provide a conference-style meeting space for panel discussions with local professionals in the building trades. 

Additionally, this facility and its programming brings together the resources of community nonprofit Project Launch and Deer Isle Adult Ed. For years, Project Launch has been supporting island high school students and their families to make a successful transition from high school to meaningful post-secondary learning and job opportunities. As many adults on the island have been facing mid-life career changes including the need to return to school, Project Launch has been a natural contact point for those community members. Sharing a space based in the larger adult community will allow Project Launch to expand entry point counseling services to people 18+, and make for supported referrals to Adult Education for workforce training and continuing education services. This site will also become a center for Haystack's Fab Lab to connect working STEM professionals to local community members. Haystack will integrate its existing residency programs that are designed to bring STEM professionals to the Deer Isle community and interact, train and support community members. Ideally this leads to a more focused workforce program where both youth and adults are exposed to career alternative pathways and opportunities. This program will be developed and piloted in collaboration with other Connectivity Hub Partners.

38 / 56   
**Health Monitoring Programs** 

What health monitoring or telehealth programming will be enabled through this project? In addition, please describe how the capital improvements will enable the mission and vision of the project and your organization. For the types of health related programming that can be supported by this program and examples please refer to the Capital Projects Fund Guidance and Connectivity Hubs Application Guidance. 

*For example, this could include workshops or individual help on learning how to use your providers telehealth portal or a health and wellness program that holds meetings in the space and uses the technology to invite guest speakers in virtually.* 

The Stonington C-HUB's partnership with the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety will be a huge, unprecedented asset for our fishing community. This health monitoring program is focused specifically on the unique health needs of fishermen, clamdiggers, and other maritime harvesters. That the possibility of the C-HUB \-- with its secure, private space and telehealth technology on the working waterfront, and not in any intimidating medical office \-- has already ignited this opportunity to have a community health worker focused on fishermen's health in our midst is beyond fantastic. This individual will also help regional to learn how to use and to access telehealth portals and other digital wellness programs as needed for aging in place and for all types of mental and physical health needs in our remote rural community, where accessing in person health care can require transportation and a drive of an hour or more. 

In addition to this part time, in residence community health worker, Deer Isle Adult Education/National Digital Equity Center will offer classes on how to video conference for telehealth. Working with Northern Light Telehealth, DIACE will also offer classes/individual help accessing telehealth using their preferred platform. 

Telehealth program managers at Northern Light Health are collaborators in the design of the Stonington C-HUB's program offerings and in recent meetings agreed that their health monitoring technology and patient telehealth visits would be even more accessible if those with basic digital literacy gaps had the support of local, trusted digital health navigators.

39 / 56   
**Device Lending & Tech Support Programs** 

Please share how your organization will provide devices and tech support, and any other digital equity plans and activities. This should include a description of devices that will be offered on site for public use, as well as computers or other devices that will be offered through loan programs, and a description of how technical support will be provided for these or personal devices. 

With this grant, Stonington's C-HUB will offer 10 internet-ready Chromebooks and iPads for lending, as well as a full digital classroom of 10 Macbook AIRs as well as interactive Promethean screens and other devices. 

Device lending, including laptops and hot spots as needed, is often a part of reducing barriers to adult education, and many programs, including Deer Isle Adult and Community Education, already offer this option to some extent. Currently DIACE has a reserve of chromebooks and Lenovo laptops (from 2020\) to support student learning. Staff teach students the device basics before lending occurs, and are available for ongoing tech support. 

Technical support for these devices will initially be provided by Deer Isle Adult and Community Education and Haystack Fab Lab staff. As the C-HUB grows and becomes better used, additional support staff will be added. The region, based in marine fishing economies, is very much a "learn by doing and talking" culture, and requires in person support for learning to be most effective.

40 / 56   
**Connection to Maine's Digital Equity Plan** 

Please describe any ways that this project will help advance strategies and goals in the State of Maine Digital Equity Plan. For example, will internet safety education be provided at this facility? Will digital skills classes by offered through this project? Will there be staff on site to provide technical support or help people access government resources and applications online? Will hotspots and other devices be available on loan to help provide affordable access for people at home? 

Stonington’s Connectivity Hub will directly advance all of the strategies of Maine’s Digital Equity Plan, except the first which the Town and partners have already worked hard to achieve for the region: 

1\. Increase access to broadband through grant funding for local and regional infrastructure projects: The Town of Stonington has been a leader in the region for helping advance universal access to broadband internet, which was named as a priority in the town’s comprehensive plan published in 2018\. Collaboration with other towns in the Peninsula Utility for Broadband (PUB) helped attract public and private investment to the region through the NTIA Mountains to Sea grant awarded in 2022\. Although CCI’s Fidium Fiber service is now available throughout the Blue Hill peninsula, many residents have still not adopted the service due to lack of awareness of how broadband can benefit their lives, or lack of digital skills, which the Connectivity Hub will help address. 

2\. Affordability of internet service by increasing enrollment in the Affordable Connectivity Program and improving connections for those in subsidized housing; If and when funding for the ACP is reinstated by Congress, the Stonington Connectivity Hub programming staff and volunteers will be trained to help enroll individuals in the program. In the meantime, Deer Isle Community and Adult Education, which will be housed in the Connectivity Hub, is an on-site partner location for NDEC’s digital literacy classes including “Affordable Internet after the ACP”. 3\. Secure at least 25,000 donated devices for refurbishment from businesses, institutions, and agencies statewide; access to no-cost and low cost devices (desktops, laptops, tablets) that meet the user’s needs \- and include technical support \- by distributing 50,000 new and refurbished devices to Mainers who need them; The Connectivity Hub will have a device lending program that compliments the lending programs at local libraries and the current operations of Deer Isle Adult and Community Education which lends devices to any enrolled students that need them. The Hub will also be a referring partner for Give IT Get IT to help connect low-income individuals to that critical resource. Haystack is already partnered with Give IT Get IT for sourcing the technology needed to run its community programs. Project partners have begun discussions for how an affordable devices program would be deployed, and with support of software budget in this application, the Hub will have the capacity to collect data on numbers of donated devices to help measure progress toward this state goal. 

4\. Improve Mainers’ digital skills through outreach and training; As described above, this work is already being done primarily by core project partner Deer Isle Adult & Community Education, both in house and in partnership with NDEC, as well as through new community programs offered by Haystack and one-on-one digital skills support

41 / 56   
provided to youth and adults through Project Launch. 

5\. Help Mainers stay safe online by providing internet safety training: Adult Education will provide training both in partnership with NDEC and through curriculum being developed in house. 

6\. Make it easier to access government resources and programs online: The Town’s leadership and partnership in the creation of this hub brings a first-hand understanding of the current challenges of accessing government resources online, as town staff regularly have to assist residents struggling with various government portals and applications. As Maine’s largest fishing port, the community is particularly aware of the digital skills gaps preventing many in the fishing industry from complying with new federally-regulated online reporting. In addition to providing direct technical assistance to residents navigating online government programs, Connectivity Hub partners will be a local conduit to support MCA in identifying needs and solutions related to this digital equity goal. 7\. Sustain and grow Maine’s investment in digital equity through outreach and education to policymakers, policy changes, and by establishing the Maine Digital Equity Fund to raise $15 million in additional capital to match federal funding by additional investment from the federal government: As referenced in the Budget Narrative, the applicant has been engaging potential funding partners for the operations of the Connectivity Hub. The success of this hub and the engagement of those funders will help tell the story Maine needs to show the critical need and value of investing in digital equity.

42 / 56   
**Led By Covered Populations** 

Please describe the ways that people who will be served by the project are involved in its design and management. This should include whether people who will be served are represented on the board or in management and decision making positions for the organization, and/or the ways that people who will be served have been or will be invited to help design or manage the project. 

*For example, the project might have an advisory council that is made up of people who represent or identify as the population who will be served by the Hub. Additionally, if your project serves people who speak a language other than English, please describe any services provided in those native languages or by native speakers of those languages.* 

The programming collaborative behind Stonington’s C-HUB offers rich possibilities for the covered populations served by the project to be involved in its design and management, and looks forward to developing its own advisory council from an evolution of those of its core partners. The C-HUB’s covered populations include low income households, older adults, incarcerated/formerly incarcerated individuals, those with language barriers, including both English language learners as well as those with low literacy levels, individuals with disabilities, and veterans. 

Haystack works with an existing community advisory board on an AmeriCorps Planning Grant to develop a STEAM youth education program. This advisory board is composed of local organizers, community members, educators, administrators, and youth. All of whom will be invited to continue to advise on this particular Connectivity Hub project. 

Deer Isle Adult and Community Education is working with RSU 24 Adult Education to identify the best ways to connect the incarcerated population (whom RSU 24 serves with classes at the Hancock County Jail) to resources to assist their process of re-entering the community. Initial ideas include: RSU24 instructors can have Hancock County Jail residents sign releases of information to pass along to Deer Isle Adult Education for smooth transfer to continued education at the Connectivity Hub; Create framework for referrals from the counselors and support services of soon to be and newly released HCJ residents; Identify further engagement opportunities with Kelley Cochrane from EMDC who is currently providing workforce planning services at HCJ on Friday mornings. Similarly, resident Project Launch will engage a group of Deer Isle-Stonington-based young people who have been recipients of Island Institute’s Compass workforce grants. Over the past 5 years, Island Institute has awarded nearly $30,000 in workforce grants to 28 individuals and organizations in the region. We will seek their input on the design/development of the Stonington C-HUB, likely through in-person meetings with them at the hub site to gather their input on how to set up the space and promote it in the community. We may also conduct a survey with

43 / 56   
this group and potentially other Deer Isle-Stonington High School students and alumni. These young adults represent rural and many also represent low-income households.

44 / 56   
**Alignment with Other State or Regional Goals** 

Are elements of the project aligned with other state or regional goals, such as economic development, workforce development, educational attainment, telehealth access, healthy aging, climate resilience or other goals? If so, please describe. If not, please enter N/A. 

Island Institute’s involvement in the development of Stonington’s Connectivity Hub is one of our contributions to the state’s goal of strengthening Maine’s workforce and increasing the educational attainment of Mainers. As a member organization of MaineSpark, together with many other state level members and local partners such as those identified in this proposal, we are working towards (and beyond) the goal that by 2025, 60% of Mainers hold education and workforce credentials that position Maine and its families for success. 

Deer Isle Adult and Community Education (DIACE) is one of over 70 Adult Education programs in the state of Maine, supported by and held accountable to both the Department of Education and the Department of Labor. It is an active and collaborative member of Adult Ed’s HUB 1, which comprises the adult education programs in Hancock and Washington Counties. Across the state and the country, adult education programs are mandated to provide access to high school completion, career/college prep, workforce training, and adult literacy. Additionally, at the local level, adult education programs traditionally offer enrichment programming that supports life long learning in topic areas deemed critical to the local community- often targeting health and wellness. 

DIACE and HUB 1 partner RSU 24 Adult Ed will begin collaborative professional development in FY 25\. Both programs serve rural peninsulas with similar demographics and economics, and see a great deal of room for collaboration and professional co-learning as we continue to develop, share, and refine our offerings. RSU 24’s Adult Ed staff currently work with people incarcerated in the Hancock County Jail, focusing primarily on high school completion prep, and personal growth. Together, with HCJ administration, the two programs can plan for and grow the services offered to incarcerated community members, and better target programming for and check in with those who were formerly incarcerated. 

Project Launch anticipates robust programming in the way of an on-going effort that targets parents of our current student group (ages 15-25 years of age), as those parents (many of whom are low-literacy, low-income and low educational achievement) have made requests of Project Launch for increased support with both their child’s transition to either college or the workforce and with their own new or transitional college and workforce pathways. The anticipated parent group will use the Connectivity Hub to increase their own computer and educational skills and meet with other parents to receive support and guidance for career changes.

45 / 56   
**Leveraging Existing Gathering Places** 

If the project is for a location that already exists as a gathering space please describe who currently uses the space, with what frequency, and for what purposes. Alternatively, if the project is for new facility but brings together organizations that have pre-existing communities, please describe how those organizations engage those communities and what the size of those communities are. If none of these apply, please enter N/A. 

The maritime region served by the Stonington C-HUB is served by two thriving local libraries, who provide some of the "spoke" services for which the C-HUB will serve as an organizing hub. Together, the two participating libraries \-- both of which have very part time staffing and hours \-- and the C-HUB will coordinate their hours of operation to complement the current access to services at both libraries, ensuring regional residents have full time access to the digital, career, educational, and health monitoring services offered. 

The C-HUB is being created with Stonington's existing Small Business Center, home to 18 small businesses who use the space Mondays \- Fridays from 9 am \- 5 pm as office and service space. The C-HUB itself will be a new facility within the embrace of this ongoing entity, adding four core partner organizations each with its own community to the mix. 

Between the three local organizations \-- Haystack, DIACE, and Project Launch \-- these organizations serve a wide range of learners ranging in age from middle grades to adults. Many of these are disadvantaged learners who do not have sufficient digital access from their homes or the skills or devices to otherwise engage with needed digital services. While each of the organizations engages their communities, covering a broad swath of the region's populations, differently they all revolve around education. 

Adding the Northeast Center for Occupational Health and Safety to this mix, with its focus on active fishermen, clammers, and other marine harvesters, extends the reach of the C-HUB to broader and more disadvantaged communities who often do not have traditional access to medical services.

46 / 56   
**Need and Impact** 

Please describe the need for this project in your community and the expected impact toward closing the digital divide for the target audience. 

Our community faces significant barriers to digital access and literacy, including limited availability of high-speed internet, lack of affordable digital devices, and insufficient knowledge or skills to navigate the digital landscape effectively. These barriers are particularly acute for our older adult population, youth from low-income families, and workers in industries facing technological disruption. The proposed project seeks to dismantle these barriers by offering a centralized hub for digital access and education, thereby ensuring that no community member is left behind in the rapidly evolving digital world. 

Enhanced Digital Literacy: By providing workshops and training sessions on digital tools and technologies, we aim to significantly improve digital literacy levels across our target audience. This foundational knowledge will empower individuals to engage confidently with digital platforms and tools, fostering greater participation in the digital economy. 

Increased Access to Digital Resources: The facility will offer an array of digital fabrication tools, high-speed internet, and computer access, making it a vital resource for individuals who otherwise lack such access at home. This will democratize the use of digital technologies, enabling community members to pursue educational opportunities, engage in remote work, and access essential services online. 

Support for Workforce Development: With a focus on both traditional and digital skills, the project supports workforce development by preparing individuals for the jobs of the future. This is particularly crucial for transitioning workers and youth entering the job market, ensuring they possess the skills necessary to thrive in a technology driven economy. 

Cultivation of a Collaborative Community: By serving as a gathering place for learning, innovation, and collaboration, the facility will strengthen community ties and foster a culture of continuous learning and mutual support. This collaborative environment will encourage the sharing of ideas and resources, further bridging the digital divide. 

Alignment with Broadband Expansion Efforts: The project complements regional efforts to expand broadband access by ensuring that once individuals are connected, they have the skills and resources to utilize the internet effectively. This holistic approach to digital inclusion is critical for realizing the full benefits of broadband expansion.

47 / 56   
**Accessibility** 

Please describe the accessibility of the facility. Is there public transportation or other local transportation service. What hours do these services have? What hours will the facility have? Will the full building be ADA-accessible? 

At the heart of the Stonington C-HUB is the creation of a fully accessible, easily accessed, comfortable and friendly space in the heart of our community. Located at the top of the hill in the center of the Upper Village on Route 15A with excellent parking and along the route of the Island Navigator public transportation service, the C-HUB will immediately be more accessible than any other public space in Stonington. 

To achieve full accessibility and a welcoming atmosphere, a central component of this request is for funding to add an elevator to an historic building and to further renovate interior spaces to provide an ease of access to programs and services that have historically been intimidating to our underserved populations. 

The goal is for the facility to coordinate with the two local libraries to ensure there is full business day and evening access to digital tools and services for those who need.

48 / 56   
**Internet Safety** 

What measures will the organization take to ensure cybersecurity at the project location as well as with devices made available through the program offerings? This might include steps to protect person data, soundproof spaces, network security protocols, etc. 

Initially, partnership with Give IT Get IT for securing devices to be used and lended from the hub will ensure that devices are set up with cybersecurity measures in place, such as automatic clearing of log-ins and data each day, as with library computers. This project budget includes lines for software to help manage the Connectivity Hub programming domain and shared systems. Early engagement of a cybersecurity consultant for identifying additional recommendations may be part of the operations budget. 

Prior to loaning out the devices, Deer Isle Adult Education will go over basic internet safety/security protocols with the borrower, and check for understanding. Additional support and training may become available as Connectivity Hub partners offer new programs and services. 

The Connectivity Hub’s network infrastructure will be part of the planning and buildout to allow for safe and controlled access to the internet from the various community users and programs. Modern cloud-based networking hardware (e.g., Ubquiti) will be setup to allow for flexible systems to meet the needs of the various partners and community members. Additionally, all Connectivity Hub devices (laptops and tablets) will be installed with restoration software to prevent permanent data from being stored on the devices. This will both ensure that devices remain functional for their lifespan as well as protect users from accidentally leaving sensitive information or data behind on the devices when returned or done using.

49 / 56   
**Impacts** 

Please explain the projects outcomes, impacts, and how they will be measured. 

The Stonington C-HUB will positively impact the health, well-being, education, and digital access of regional residents. Outcomes will include but not be limited to: 

\* the creation of a first-time dataset around fishermen's health 

\* more fishermen and marine workers participating in health monitoring and wellness programs \* a higher percentage of the region's elder population aging in place by taking advantage of telehealth services and community health programs 

\* more successful career transitions for our adult populations as the backbone of our economy, the fishing industry, is changed by climate and regulations 

\* a greater % of our underserved populations with access to digital tools and literacy to enable them to better participate in educational and workforce programs 

In order to measure these impacts, we will first have to gather and document more comprehensive baseline information. That said, from the beginning the C-HUB will initiate simple digital procedures for documenting who visits, who participates, who is served, and with which of the C-HUB's many programs. In addition to this quantitative data, the C-HUB's core programming partners will collaborate on systems and procedures for gathering regular qualitative data that tells the stories of the ways these programs positively impact the quality of the lives who now have access to them.

**Project Budget Narrative** 

Please provide a narrative explanation of any unusual or unconventional expenses in the budget workbook and budget justifications and rationale behind such expenses. In addition, please explain how the budget aligns with the overall project plan and objectivies and clarify why proposed expenses are necessary for the successful implementation of the project. This narrative will help reviewers understand and assess the budgetary components of the proposed project. 

This budget accomplishes many things. The least visible of these is that it secures an historic, 1905 building as an important community anchor institution. Without these renovations, and in particular the addition of an elevator to the massive 3-story structure, this building would otherwise be on its way to becoming a parking lot. The addition of the elevator and the electrical and connectivity upgrades are key to the relevance, function, and survival of an important structural asset. 

In addition, with more than $100,000 of the budget dedicated to world-class digital technologies and much more dedicated to interior furnishings and upgrades, this budget aligns with our plan to create a welcoming, state-of-the art hub to take regional residents based primarily in marine economies, as well as the State's most productive fishing port, successfully into the future. 

The prominent, newly designed and outfitted space will attract regional residents to the services they may not want but now need: workforce pathways, career transitions, and health monitoring. Combining these services with a maker space will ensure the hub reaches a generational breadth of ages and needs, inviting all to walk into a vibrant future together. These upgrades to an historic building will not only generate a renewed sense of pride in area residents but potentially serve as a model to others of Maine's small rural communities of how to successfully repurpose buildings to support the transitions of our communities to the future.

**Anticipated Revenue** 

Please provide an explanation of the projected funding to sustain the project for five years post-construction, noting secured, pending and projected revenue. This should include both ongoing operations and program delivery. 

The Stonington Connectivity Hub is unique in that it represents a collaboration of well-funded, long-time organizations who will serve as its "anchor tenants" and primary program and service providers. Deer Isle Adult and Community Education, funded year after year as a portion of the district school budget, anchors the staffing as well as key digital literacy and workforce transition programs. Secured, 3-year funding for a half-time community health worker to be co-located in the space providing health monitoring programs further provides stability and sustainability; as does the need of Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, founded in 1950, for a year-round community space. Additionally, we have been pleased to note the interest of several private, major donors in both the Hub concept and specific programs around marine workforce transitions, and while this private funding is not yet fully secured we are optimistic that it will be. The four sources of stable funding will ensure not only sustainable operations but also that the programs delivered remain free to the community.

**Financial Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning** 

Please provide a detailed narrative of the project's financial contingency and risk mitigation plans. For example, line of credit-- what if anything is contingent and list out external or contingent parties (i.e., selectboard meeting). 

The project's financial contingency is based on the Programming Collaborative's ability to complete negotiations with interested major donors and other funders to secure sustainable operations funding for five years and beyond. To mitigate this risk, the Town has agreed to underwrite rental and utility costs for the new hub; and a Memorandum of Understanding amongst the core program partners secures these organizational operating funds (see including operations budgets from Deer Isle Adult Education and Haystack). 

As a publicly owned and operated building, the building's future is always subject to the will of the governing selectboard as well as voters at Town Meeting, who fund its ongoing maintenance. This risk, however, is well mitigated by the fact that since its conversion to small office space in 2001 the building has been fully rented and covering its costs; and the introductions of paid-for renovations and the addition of the Connectivity Hub to the ongoing rental mix does not change that. In other words, the broader building around the Hub will continue to operate as a small profit center for the Town \-- enough to sustain itself without returning to the voters for additional support.
