From Samantha: *Attached is the latest draft of the brand toolkit. Let’s focus on finalizing **color and typography** so I can deliver the polished version along with all the logo assets (SVGs and any other file formats you need). I’d love your eyes especially on the **color direction**:I’m recommending a deep blue paired with a light “Salt” tone as our primary colors — clean, modern, and easy to use. I’ve included a few sample variations for review; there’s no need to adopt a variation if you don’t want to, but if one feels right, please share your thoughts.  We can also work on that as a future project.* Great direction \- James ready to start building website at [islandconnectivityhub.org](http://islandconnectivityhub.org)  Other [Q2 report in process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKvPRuV13E2bqiR8GZXPpyC9ouoN6Cczhyq2t9_GG7E/edit?tab=t.0) Any fundraising plans?

Hands-on, not as digital oriented Who is the right person to design the website vs. how it looks stylistically Samantha is embedded in the community, has an understanding of the community, can help the community ‘see’ themselves in this work Clarify \- designing an online experience is different from this initial design proposal, watch out for scope creep Discussion:  negotiate \- modify what she proposed or ask her to cut it in half, go back to Samantha and develop a sequenced scope to help bring down the cost and spread it out over time Will  she be part of our team?  MCA will support our approach. Can she facilitate a meeting to help get to the core pieces we need for the design work to move forward. What is the name of this thing? Importance of the history, also need a new name DISCo Hub was well received at the Fisherman’s Forum ‘The Old School’ or ‘School House’ is an important identity too 3\.

Next meeting: April 14 \- core group C-Hub, 4pm |
| March 24, 2025 Recap: James has been in conversation with the program officer and with Perry about whether Haystack is a good fit.  Question about capacity for supporting an Americorp fellow, no additional money to help defray the cost of supporting the person. Our scale is questionable.  Haystack’s afterschool programming is not enough to provide enough work for 2 positions (can divide it up, fractional service member years), ex. Could have a full time summer person and then a different person doing school year work OK to have other orgs (ex. Adult Ed, DISHS) with similar work join in.  If there is a throughline, cohesive logic model, then it could work. Morgan: What is Haystack’s scope of work, want to align with that Maker’s Space is a likely place for collaboration, focus on tech skills, and also be responsive to community needs Demand is more for professional suite training \- ex. Spreadsheets, quick books, etc., not a clear fit for the FabLab Make and Takes can be the way in to attract adults Good way to increase service in the near term Haystack’s ideas for the Fellow/scope of work:   Make and Take programming \- can be similar to the afterschool programming activities School year \- curriculum development, 2 weekly engagements for after school programming Summer \- High school internship program \- facilitating youth development program/internship  Concept Stem Education Boot Camp \- don’t want to develop new programming, but would require that we develop a stem education boot camp training program to onboard the fellows, could be a long range benefit for the C-Hub down the road Some safety training on the equipment, project based Education theory \- see 1, do 1, teach 1 Yvonne Idea \- Look into what St. George is doing to integrate PK-8 curriculum into the Makerspace, could lead to PD opportunities with teachers to strengthen the connection between the school and the C-Hub Technology Discussion: There will be need for coding in the future as boats become more computer based, bigger question \- how do rural communities benefit from/train for new technologies Cyber security? It is offered at HCTC, but not at the high school High priority for MCA Morgan is taking a train the trainer course on personal finance (and is also taking entrepreneurship) \- includes cyber security \- Nationwide course through Adult Ed Entrepreneurship is relevant to Haystack \- help artists become more successful II’s Creative Economy Hub \- https://www.islandinstitute.org/creative-economy-hub/  |

Notes:  First question on Goals \- what folks want from an evaluation Linda: Connectivity Hub /Town of Stonington needs to be able to report to MCA \- How many people are we serving, and how many have we touched Christa shared additional context on demographic data needed based on digital equity act/covered populations Pamela \- evaluating efficacy of networks and structural  Julie: couple different purposes of evaluation/data for community-driven projects —  baseline \- use for grant applications, etc Mid-course corrections Pamela \- looking at community systems\* Also looking at many of the metrics this group has been discussing \- impact of the community health worker goal  Kristin \- In creating the Connectivity Hub goals \- *how* did you make decisions  How did you build relationships as community partners What were the challenges/constraints Christa’s next steps: Email Mandy to thank her for organizing and ask if she had any questions Pull in Nick & Sam for a follow-up conversation on II interest in this opportunity  |

For training the Americorp member to then deliver services at the hub, ex. Digital training, it will likely be young adults Haystack \- doesn’t have enough service member hours for a full application, so thinking that it’s better for a collaborative proposal or another C-Hub Happy to support an application when the time comes, we can be thinking about whether it makes sense for us to apply as a C-Hub  Discussion: Staffing \- Linda \- need to figure out staffing for the C-Hub This is a chance for us to describe a new position we could launch Linda \- getting ‘commercial demand’ for the maker space Could it run as a modern day ‘Kinkos’, on demand with help There are some well established models for this, and also some unsuccessful ways to do it Important to gather data and do a needs-assessment to determining what is needed locally Haystack \- avoids being a ‘shop’ \- prefers to teach people how to do it themselves Go more towards drone photography and podcasting before custom fabrication Adult Ed directors at the state level are submitting an MCA grant, train the trainer model Hancock County \- looking to get capacity in the county, could pair well with the Americorp \- help address the digital literacy needs Americorp \- Think about it over three years as a pilot/proof of concept, could be continued funding Adult Ed/Project Launch Strategic Planning \- C-hub needs to align with that plan, lots of info coming on Wednesday, then community surveying Morgan \- will put together a sensible budget for SY25/26 that allows for some workforce development, strategic plan will show up more in the SY26/27 Aims to have it done by May or June  Next step: Focus on needs around digital literacy skills and workforce training \- what are the needs and skills and what could realistically be done?
